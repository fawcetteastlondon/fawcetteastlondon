<p>Less than two weeks until our inaugural pub quiz and it's shaping up nicely. We've got a Â£50 cash prize thanks to the Association of Women Solicitors London (www.awslondon.co.uk), some really cute spot prizes from Hand Over Your Fairy Cakes (www.hoyfc.com) and loads of great raffle prizes too - watch this space for more details.</p>
<p>We've roped in a seasoned quiz master for the evening and a small team of our  members is hard at work packing the schedule full of interesting questions and fun challenges.</p>
<p>We'll also be collecting for the Red Box Project (www.redboxproject.org) so bring along any donations of sanitary or feminine hygiene products who'd like to them to pass onto local schools</p>
<p>Make sure you get your ticket before we sell out! https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/fawcett-east-london-summer-fundraising-quiz-tickets-47212791731</p>
