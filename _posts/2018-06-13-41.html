<p>On 7th July the Fawcett Society are running a one-off training session for anyone interested in becoming a volunteer for their Future Fawcett schools outreach programme. It's a great programme and you just need to be able to attend the training and ideally co-run one or more sessions in a school over the next six months. Message us for more information or sign up via <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/future-fawcett-volunteer-training-07-july-tickets-47019742315">Eventbrite</a>.</p>
<p>Here's some more information from Fawcett HQ:</p>
<p>Future Fawcett is our schools outreach program, launched at the beginning of 2018. We've devised a series of workshops, roughly about 60mins long, to engage young people aged between 14-18 years old, in the history of women's suffrage and the current state of women's rights in the UK.</p>
<p>The workshops ask the young people to 'vote on their feet' on a number of posed statements, for example, 'do you consider yourself a feminist'. The students divide into 'yes', 'no' and 'not sure' groups, at which point the workshop leader facilitates conversations about why each student has chosen their particular group. The aim is to get the young people to think critically about their own position and what the implications of their choice might be. </p>
<p>The aim is to reach 10,000 young people in 2018. To help achieve this, we've trained up a number of volunteer Fawcett supporters to deliver the workshops themselves, to help extend our reach as far as possible. As a small organisation our capacity is limited, so these volunteers have played a crucial role in helping us to deliver the workshops, however we still need to train up more to meet the demand we've had from schools. A number of high profile sessions have raised the profile of of the program significantly, and interest in the workshops has spiked. At present, we've reached nearly 4,000 young people, but we will need additional volunteer support to help reach our 10,000 target by training more workshop leaders. </p>
<p>In December 2017 the Mayor of London joined Fawcett for a workshop about our suffrage history and driving forward gender equality, at Platanos College in South London. The session marked the launch of #BehindEveryGreatCity, a year-long campaign led by Sadiq Khan to celebrate 100 years since women secured the vote.The students had an incredible time learning about women's lives 100 years ago, the rights they have gained since - and how far we still have to go to achieve gender equality.</p>
<p>In April 2018, we led workshops for 60 students from across London at City Hall, followed by a very special Q&amp;A session with the Prime Minister of Canada Justin Trudeau and the Prime Minister of New Zealand Jacinda Ardern. Trudeau asked the students about gender balance in their feminist clubs at school, and stressed how important it is to get men involved in discussions about gender equality. Ardern cited her mother as her inspiration for her 'generosity and kindness', and told a participant with ambitions to become the prime minister to never stop believing in herself.</p>
