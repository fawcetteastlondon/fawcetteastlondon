<p>Welcome to the latest update of East London Fawcett’s news, a recap of what was discussed at our July meeting and a look at the events we’ve got coming up over the next few weeks. </p></p>
<p>For those of you who couldn’t make the meeting, it was a corker. I can vouch for the quality of the biscuits and topics ranged from Trump’s visit and the women’s march through to rioting after Wetherspoons. See what you’ve missed? Definitely come along next time. </p></p>
<p>We really did cover a lot, including our plans to ramp up the group’s social media. We’re a democratic bunch and more than happy to crowdsource content, everyone is welcome to submit content and we’re always on the lookout for people to get more involved. So get in touch if that could be you or if you have something you think we should be sharing/talking about.</p></p>
<p>The second half of the meeting was hosted by Victoria, our legal/Instagram guru, who gave a very informative presentation on the legalities of sex work in the UK, how our laws compare to other countries, and what the repercussions/effects of those laws are. </p></p>
<p>It goes without saying that this is a complex topic and the statistics alone were quite staggering. To see what you missed, take a look at <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/129xi9ULCRfdi5Q4xtna_8n5yj1fkNpfzZTgQt9CmcRE/edit?usp=sharing">Victoria’s presentation</a> for yourself, or if you fancy some slightly denser bedtime reading, you can also look at the <a href="https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201617/cmselect/cmhaff/26/26.pdf">Home Affairs Select Committee Report on Prostitution</a> and the <a href="https://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons-committees/home-affairs/Govt-Response-Cm9361-Prostitution.pdf">Government’s 2016 response</a>. The conversation brought up related topics such as the porn industry and the slightly scary <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/25/raw-hatred-why-incel-movement-targets-terrorises-women">In-Cel phenomenon</a> and <a href="https://appgprostitution.uk/inquiry/">pop-up brothels</a>, so no doubt we’ll be exploring all these issues further at a future meeting. </p></p>
<p>So what’s on the horizon for Fawcett over the next few weeks? I’m glad you asked...</p></p>
<p><b>TOMORROW - 12 JULY - Women’s Hall exhibition</b></p></p>
<p>On Thursday 12 July we’re teaming up with the Women’s Equality Party Tower Hamlets branch to visit the <a href="https://eastendwomensmuseum.org/the-womens-hall/">Women’s Hall exhibition</a> in Mile End. The exhibition tells the stories of the East London Federation of the Suffragettes, their work campaigning for the vote and their various wartime projects. On the night, poet and author Chris Searle will be reading from Sylvia Pankhurst’s poems written during the time she spent in Holloway prison. </p></p>
<p>You don’t have to have been to a meeting before, everyone is welcome, and we’re a friendly bunch. Meet us outside Tower Hamlets Local History Library and Archives (277 Bancroft Rd, London E1 4DQ) at 6pm or come or find us inside after that.</p></p>
<p>FRIDAY 13 JULY - Women’s March </p></p>
<p>This Friday we’ll be taking to the streets with thousands of other people at the Women’s March in response to Trump’s visit to the UK. It seems that he’ll be spending most of his time here playing golf, but nonetheless it’s a great opportunity to take a stand against what he stands for and also to witness the wonder of the flying <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jul/06/trump-baby-blimp-snowflake-right-london">Trump baby blimp</a>. We’ll be meeting outside Portland Place for the 11am start. Look out for the big Fawcett Society banner on the day or get in touch beforehand if you want to come along. Placards at the ready, it’s going to be historic! </p></p>

<p><b>17 JULY - Reclaim the Frame</b></p></p>
<p>Also on the agenda is the Reclaim the Frame screening of Pin Cushion at Genesis Cinema. Check out the film’s <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/pin_cushion/">Rotten Tomatoes</a> page to read more about this ‘devilishly dark coming-of-age movie’ telling the story of a mother and daughter who attempt to make a new life in a new town.</p></p>
<p>This will be our second outing supporting <a href="https://www.birds-eye-view.co.uk/event/reclaim-the-frame-london-launch-2/">Reclaim the Frame</a>, a project designed to grow audiences for films by women and showing four films in selected cinemas over the summer. </p></p>
<p>Get your <a href="https://genesiscinema.co.uk/GenesisCinema.dll/WhatsOn?Film=12390718">tickets here</a> and drop us a line if you’re planning to come along so we can meet you before the screening.</p></p>
<p><b>24 JULY - At Last! Votes for Women at LSE</b></p></p>
<p>On 24 July, we’ll be getting a private tour of LSE’s suffrage exhibition <u>At Last! Votes for Women.</u> The exhibition features many items from Millicent Garrett Fawcett’s archive, along with material from other suffrage groups. We’ll also have the pleasure of being shown around the exhibition by its curator Dr Gillian Murphy, so not to be missed, but if you can’t make it then, the exhibition is open until September 5th.</p></p>
<p><b>AAAAND...</b></p></p>
<p>Last but certainly not least, our fundraising quiz! It’s taking place on 23 August at the Scolt Head in Dalston. Hold the date in your diary, start spreading the word and getting a team together! We’re busy sorting some great rounds and also sourcing some excellent prizes. If you can help and if you know anyone who might be willing to donate a prize, please get in touch. </p></p>
<p>Proceeds will be going to Fawcett (of course), to help support their brilliant work, like this: https://www.fawcettsociety.org.uk/sex-power-2018. </p></p>
<p>So lots to look forward to. We’d love to see you at these outings, new members and old - everybody’s welcome! If you haven’t been to a meeting before they’re quite informal. It’s an opportunity to learn and talk about feminism, meet like-minded people and to have a bit of fun too. So keep an eye on this blog, our Twitter and Instagram accounts (@fawcetteastldn) for details of our next meeting and updates on the events, or email us at <a href="mailto:fawcetteastldn@gmail.com">fawcetteastldn@gmail.com</a> to find out more.</p>
