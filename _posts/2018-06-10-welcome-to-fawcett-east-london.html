<p>Welcome to the first in our regular updates on our monthly meetings and what’s coming up over the next few months. There are a lot of exciting events coming up in the next few weeks and it would be great to see lots of you joining us.</p>

<p>We’re pleased to announce that we are supporting ‘Reclaim the Frame’, a campaign to promote women in the film industry. The project is running a series of film screenings over the summer  aiming to provide spaces for female film makers in order to ‘prove that films by women are commercially viable and in demand’. The next screening is of ‘Pin Cushion’, a coming of age story of a mother and daughter on the 17<sup>th</sup> July at Genesis Theatre in Stepney Green.  Come and join us there, or if you'd like to find out more about the project check out the  <a href="https://www.birds-eye-view.co.uk/influencers/">Reclaim the Frame website.</a>.</p>

<p>As part of the Great Get Together, Fawcett society is inviting us all to a picnic at the feet of the statue of Millicent Fawcett, the first statue of a woman in Parliament Square. It’s a chance to hear from Fawcett society HQ about all the successes and celebrations we’ve enjoyed this year and all the ongoing work that we’re all working on together. The picnic is on the 24<sup>th</sup> June and is a great opportunity to get to know some like minded people. Please click <a href="https://www.fawcettsociety.org.uk/Event/a-great-get-together-picnic-with-millicent-fawcett" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here </a>for more information.</p>
<p>On Thursday 12<sup>th</sup> July we will be teaming up with the Women’s Equality Party Tower Hamlets branch to visit the Women’s Hall exhibition in Mile End. The exhibition aims to tell the stories of the East London Federation of the Suffragettes and their work campaigning for the vote and their various wartime projects. On the night, poet and author Chris Searle will also be reading from Sylvia Pankhurst’s poems written during the time she spent in Holloway prison. The exhibition is running through the summer and there are lots of events to get involved with so to find out more please click <a href="https://eastendwomensmuseum.org/the-womens-hall/">here.</a></p>
<p>We’ve got lots of other exciting events and opportunities coming up which we’ll be discussing at our next meeting in July, including a potential school trip to the Feminist Library and planning for our biggest fundraising event to date, a pub quiz to raise funds for all the important work that Fawcett society do. If you’d like to be involved or learn more please do sign up to our next session <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/fawcett-east-london-july-meeting-tickets-46798062264?ref=estw">via our Eventbrite Page </a>or find us on Twitter or Instragram at <a href="https://twitter.com/fawcetteastldn?lang=en">@fawcetteastldn</a>.</p>
<p>Our meetings are always quite informal but come in the form of a discussion surrounding a topic, led by one of our members and then a proactive session on fundraising or event planning. Next month we’ll be discussing Sex Work and our upcoming fundraising activities and we’d like to see as many of you there as possible. Our meetings are always very relaxed, no prior expertise on the topic needed!  If you're interested in learning more about feminism and the Fawcett Society or wanting to get more pro actively involved, this is the group for you! Keep an eye out on the blog, Twitter or Instagram for details of our next meeting and events we're attending, or email us at <a class="o365button" role="link"><span class="ms-font-s ms-font-color-themePrimary" title="fawcetteastldn@gmail.com">fawcetteastldn@gmail.com </span></a>to find out more.</p>
